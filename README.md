# mathjax-wrapper

A slim Atom package to expose the awesome
[MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/mathjax) library in Atom.

## Installation

Search for **mathjax-wrapper** in the menu **File &rsaquo; Settings &rsaquo;
Packages** and click **Install**. Alternatively if you would prefer to use the
command line utility `apm`:

````bash
$ apm install mathjax-wrapper
````

## Troubleshooting

- **Installation is taking a long time**  
  The package is ~55MB in size and contain ~32000 files, so it takes a little
  while for Atom to install mathjax-wrapper. As Atom provides no feedback as to
  the progress of the installation, the installation could be perceived to have
  stalled, but this is unlikely. Please allow plenty of time (10-15mins) for
  installation.
